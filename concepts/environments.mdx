The execution environment determines where and how tools run. The qckfx Agent SDK supports three environment types, with **local execution being the primary supported option**. Understanding these environments helps you choose the right setup for your security, performance, and isolation requirements.

## Local Environment (Primary Support)

<Warning>
**Only Supported Environment**: According to the current schema, only 'local' execution is supported. The environment field only accepts the string 'local', not an object.
</Warning>

The local execution adapter runs tools directly in the same process as your application:

```typescript
const agent = await Agent.create({
  config: {
    environment: 'local', // String value, not object
    defaultModel: 'claude-sonnet-3-7',
    // ... other config
  }
});
```

### Characteristics

**‚úÖ Fully supported** and actively maintained
- **Fast execution** with no container overhead
- **Direct file system access** to your project
- **Simple setup** with no additional dependencies
- **Native performance** for all tool operations

**‚ö†Ô∏è Security consideration**: Tools run with the same permissions as your application

### Use Cases

Local execution is ideal for:
- **Development and testing** environments
- **Trusted environments** where security isolation isn't critical
- **Performance-critical applications** requiring minimal overhead
- **Simple deployments** without container infrastructure

### Setup

No additional setup required beyond installing the SDK:

```bash
npm install @qckfx/agent
```

```typescript
import { Agent } from '@qckfx/agent';

const agent = await Agent.create({
  config: {
    environment: 'local',
    defaultModel: 'claude-sonnet-3-7',
    tools: ['bash', 'file_read', 'file_write', 'file_edit']
  }
});
```

## Docker Environment (Limited Support)

<Info>
**Limited Support**: While the Docker execution adapter exists and may work, it's not currently the development team's priority. Use with caution and expect potential issues.
</Info>

The Docker adapter runs tools in an isolated container environment:

```typescript
const agent = await Agent.create({
  config: {
    environment: { 
      type: 'docker',
      docker: {
        projectRoot: '/path/to/your/project'
      }
    },
    // ... other config
  }
});
```

### Characteristics

**üîí Isolated execution** environment
- **Consistent runtime** across different systems
- **Security isolation** from the host system
- **Reproducible environments** for testing

**‚ö†Ô∏è Limited support** - may require debugging
- **Slower startup** due to container initialization
- **Additional complexity** in setup and maintenance
- **Resource overhead** from containerization

### Use Cases

Docker execution might be suitable for:
- **Security-sensitive environments** requiring isolation
- **Multi-tenant applications** with untrusted code
- **Consistent deployment environments** across teams
- **Testing scenarios** requiring clean environments

### Setup Requirements

Docker execution requires additional setup:

1. **Docker Installation**: Ensure Docker is installed and running
2. **Container Configuration**: Set up appropriate Docker images
3. **Volume Mounting**: Configure project directory access
4. **Network Configuration**: Set up container networking if needed

```bash
# Example Docker setup (configuration may vary)
docker build -t qckfx-agent-env .
docker run -v $(pwd):/workspace qckfx-agent-env
```

## Remote Environment (Limited Support)

<Info>
**Limited Support**: The remote execution adapter (E2B integration) exists but is not actively maintained. Current schema restrictions only allow local execution.
</Info>

The remote adapter runs tools in cloud-based sandboxes:

```typescript
const agent = await Agent.create({
  config: {
    environment: { type: 'remote' },
    // ... other config
  },
  callbacks: {
    getRemoteId: async () => process.env.REMOTE_ID!
  }
});
```

### Characteristics

**‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud-based execution** in managed sandboxes
- **Maximum isolation** from your local system
- **Scalable infrastructure** managed by the provider
- **Consistent environments** across different clients

**‚ö†Ô∏è Limited support** and schema restrictions
- **Network dependency** for all operations
- **Latency overhead** for tool execution
- **External service dependency** on cloud providers
- **Additional costs** for cloud sandbox usage

### Use Cases

Remote execution could be useful for:
- **Maximum security isolation** requirements
- **Scalable multi-tenant applications**
- **Environments without local compute resources**
- **Compliance scenarios** requiring external execution

## Environment Selection Guidelines

<Tip>
**Recommendation**: Use the local execution environment unless you have specific security or isolation requirements. It provides the best performance and is the only fully supported option.
</Tip>

Choose your environment based on your needs:

### Local Environment
- ‚úÖ **Best for**: Development, testing, most production use cases
- ‚úÖ **When**: Performance is critical and security isolation isn't required
- ‚úÖ **Advantages**: Fast, simple, fully supported
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Consider**: Security implications of running tools with application permissions

### Docker Environment  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Best for**: Security-conscious environments willing to handle potential issues
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **When**: Isolation is required and you can manage container complexity
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Advantages**: Security isolation, consistent environments
- ‚ùå **Drawbacks**: Limited support, performance overhead, setup complexity

### Remote Environment
- ‚ùå **Not recommended**: Due to limited support and schema restrictions
- ‚ùå **Current status**: Not actively maintained
- ‚ùå **Limitations**: Schema only allows 'local' environment type

## Execution Adapter Interface

All environments implement the same `ExecutionAdapter` interface, ensuring consistent tool behavior:

```typescript
interface ExecutionAdapter {
  executeCommand(id: string, command: string, workingDir?: string): Promise<CommandResult>;
  readFile(id: string, filepath: string, options?: ReadOptions): Promise<FileContent>;
  writeFile(id: string, filepath: string, content: string): Promise<void>;
  editFile(id: string, filepath: string, searchCode: string, replaceCode: string): Promise<EditResult>;
  listFiles(id: string, path: string, options?: ListOptions): Promise<FileList>;
  findFiles(id: string, pattern: string, options?: FindOptions): Promise<FileList>;
  searchFiles(id: string, pattern: string, options?: SearchOptions): Promise<SearchResults>;
  // ... other methods
}
```

This abstraction allows you to switch between environments without changing your agent code, though local execution is strongly recommended for reliability and support.

## Performance Considerations

### Local Environment Performance
- **Fastest execution** with no overhead
- **Direct file system access** for optimal I/O
- **Native process execution** for commands
- **Minimal memory footprint**

### Docker Environment Performance
- **Container startup overhead** for each session
- **File system mounting** may impact I/O performance
- **Network overhead** for container communication
- **Additional memory usage** for container runtime

### Remote Environment Performance
- **Network latency** for all operations
- **Bandwidth limitations** for large file operations
- **Service availability** dependency
- **Potential rate limiting** from cloud providers

## Security Considerations

### Local Environment Security
- Tools run with **application permissions**
- **Direct access** to file system and network
- **No isolation** from host system
- **Trust required** in tool implementations

### Docker Environment Security
- **Process isolation** from host system
- **Limited file system access** through volume mounts
- **Network isolation** capabilities
- **Container escape** risks (though minimal)

### Remote Environment Security
- **Maximum isolation** from local system
- **Managed security** by cloud provider
- **Network-only attack surface**
- **Data transmission** security considerations

## Troubleshooting

### Local Environment Issues
- **Permission errors**: Check file system permissions
- **Path issues**: Verify working directory settings
- **Tool failures**: Check tool-specific error messages

### Docker Environment Issues
- **Container startup failures**: Check Docker configuration
- **Volume mounting problems**: Verify path mappings
- **Network connectivity**: Check container networking
- **Image compatibility**: Ensure proper base images

### Remote Environment Issues
- **Connection failures**: Check network connectivity
- **Authentication problems**: Verify API credentials
- **Service availability**: Check provider status
- **Rate limiting**: Monitor usage quotas

## Migration Between Environments

While the interface consistency allows for environment switching, consider these factors:

### From Local to Docker
- **Performance impact**: Expect slower execution
- **Setup complexity**: Requires Docker configuration
- **File path changes**: May need path adjustments
- **Limited support**: Prepare for potential issues

### From Local to Remote
- **Currently not possible**: Schema restrictions prevent remote environment
- **Future consideration**: May become available in future versions
- **Network dependency**: Would require stable internet connection
- **Cost implications**: Cloud sandbox usage fees

## Best Practices

### Local Environment
- **Monitor permissions**: Be aware of what tools can access
- **Validate inputs**: Sanitize tool parameters carefully
- **Error handling**: Implement robust error recovery
- **Resource monitoring**: Watch for resource usage

### Docker Environment (if used)
- **Container management**: Properly clean up containers
- **Volume security**: Limit mounted directories
- **Image maintenance**: Keep base images updated
- **Resource limits**: Set appropriate container limits

### General Recommendations
- **Start with local**: Use local environment for development
- **Test thoroughly**: Validate tool behavior in your chosen environment
- **Monitor performance**: Track execution times and resource usage
- **Plan for scaling**: Consider environment implications for production
