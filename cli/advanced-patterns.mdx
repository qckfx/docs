The qckfx CLI's session management enables powerful advanced patterns where you can dynamically change agents, models, and sub-agents while maintaining conversation context. This allows for sophisticated workflows that adapt to evolving requirements within a single conversation thread.

## Core Concept: Dynamic Context Switching

Since sessions are tied to your working directory, you can use different CLI configurations for each message while maintaining conversation history. This enables:

- **Agent Switching**: Move between specialized agent configurations
- **Model Switching**: Upgrade or downgrade model capabilities mid-conversation  
- **Sub-agent Flexibility**: Add or remove specialized tools as needed

<Info>
All examples assume you're working in the same directory throughout the conversation. Session continuity depends on maintaining the same working directory.

## Pattern 1: Agent to Model Switching

Start with a specialized agent configuration, then switch to a direct model for simpler follow-ups.

### Example: Security Analysis to Quick Questions

```bash
# Initial message: Use specialized security agent
qckfx -a security-agent "Analyze this codebase for potential security vulnerabilities"

# Follow-up: Switch to direct model for quick clarification
qckfx -c -m claude-sonnet-4 "What's the difference between XSS and CSRF again?"

# Continue: Back to security agent for detailed work
qckfx -c -a security-agent "Now help me fix the XSS vulnerability you found"
```

**Why This Works:**
- The security agent has specialized tools and prompts for vulnerability analysis
- Direct model access is faster for simple conceptual questions
- Returning to the agent provides full tooling for implementation

### Example: Documentation Agent to Model Comparison

```bash
# Start with documentation-focused agent
qckfx -a docs-agent "Generate API documentation for this Express.js application"

# Switch to powerful model for comparison
qckfx -c -m claude-sonnet-4 "Compare this API design with REST best practices"

# Continue with original agent for updates
qckfx -c -a docs-agent "Update the documentation based on those recommendations"
```

## Pattern 2: Model to Agent Switching

Begin with a direct model call, then escalate to a specialized agent when you need more capabilities.

### Example: Quick Question to Deep Analysis

```bash
# Start simple: Direct model for quick assessment
qckfx -m gemini-2.5-pro "Is this React component following best practices?"

# Escalate: Switch to specialized agent for detailed analysis
qckfx -c -a code-review-agent "Now perform a comprehensive code review with specific recommendations"

# Continue: Use agent's full capabilities
qckfx -c -a code-review-agent "Generate unit tests for the issues you identified"
```

### Example: Brainstorming to Implementation

```bash
# Brainstorm with a creative model
qckfx -m claude-sonnet-4 "Help me brainstorm features for a task management app"

# Switch to development agent for implementation
qckfx -c -a fullstack-agent "Let's implement the priority-based task sorting feature"

# Continue development work
qckfx -c -a fullstack-agent "Add database migrations for the new priority field"
```

## Pattern 3: Sub-agent Addition and Removal

Dynamically add sub-agents when you need specialized capabilities, then remove them when they're no longer needed.

### Example: Research Phase to Implementation Phase

```bash
# Phase 1: Start with research sub-agent
qckfx --with-subagent browser "Research the latest authentication patterns for Node.js applications"

# Phase 2: Remove research, add database sub-agent for schema design
qckfx -c --with-subagent database "Design a user authentication schema based on that research"

# Phase 3: Remove sub-agents, use base agent for implementation
qckfx -c "Implement the authentication middleware using the schema we designed"
```

**Pattern Breakdown:**
- **Message 1**: Browser sub-agent provides web research capabilities
- **Message 2**: Database sub-agent provides schema design expertise  
- **Message 3**: Base agent handles straightforward implementation

### Example: Multi-Phase Analysis

```bash
# Initial analysis with multiple sub-agents
qckfx --with-subagent browser security "Analyze current security trends and assess our application"

# Focus on security recommendations
qckfx -c --with-subagent security "Provide specific security improvements for our codebase"

# Implementation without sub-agents
qckfx -c "Implement the recommended security headers middleware"
```

## Pattern 4: Complex Multi-Agent Workflows

Combine agent switching, model changes, and sub-agent management for sophisticated workflows.

### Example: Full Development Lifecycle

```bash
# 1. Research phase: Model + research sub-agent
qckfx -m claude-sonnet-4 --with-subagent browser "Research modern React state management solutions"

# 2. Architecture phase: Switch to architecture agent
qckfx -c -a architecture-agent "Design a state management architecture for our e-commerce app"

# 3. Security review: Add security sub-agent
qckfx -c -a architecture-agent --with-subagent security "Review the architecture for security implications"

# 4. Implementation: Switch to development agent, remove sub-agents
qckfx -c -a fullstack-agent "Implement the Redux Toolkit setup based on our architecture"

# 5. Testing: Add testing sub-agent
qckfx -c -a fullstack-agent --with-subagent testing "Generate comprehensive tests for the state management"

# 6. Documentation: Switch to docs agent
qckfx -c -a docs-agent "Create developer documentation for the state management implementation"
```

### Example: Debugging Workflow

```bash
# 1. Initial problem assessment with general model
qckfx -m gemini-2.5-pro "I'm getting a 500 error in my API. Help me understand what might be wrong"

# 2. Deep debugging with specialized agent and database sub-agent
qckfx -c -a debug-agent --with-subagent database "Analyze the database queries and connection issues"

# 3. Security check during debugging
qckfx -c -a debug-agent --with-subagent security "Check if this error reveals any security vulnerabilities"

# 4. Final fix with development agent
qckfx -c -a fullstack-agent "Implement the fix with proper error handling and logging"
```

## Pattern 5: Model Capability Scaling

Dynamically adjust model capabilities based on task complexity within the same conversation.

### Example: Progressive Complexity

```bash
# Start with efficient model for simple tasks
qckfx -m gemini-2.5-pro "List the main components in this React application"

# Scale up for complex analysis
qckfx -c -m claude-sonnet-4 "Analyze the component architecture and suggest performance optimizations"

# Scale down for implementation
qckfx -c -m gemini-2.5-pro "Implement the memoization changes you suggested"

# Scale up for final review
qckfx -c -m claude-sonnet-4 "Review the changes and ensure they follow React best practices"
```

### Example: Cost-Conscious Development

```bash
# Use cost-effective model for routine tasks
qckfx -m gemini-2.5-pro "Add TypeScript types to this JavaScript file"

# Upgrade for complex problem-solving
qckfx -c -m claude-sonnet-4 "This type inference is failing. Help me debug the complex generic types"

# Return to efficient model for implementation
qckfx -c -m gemini-2.5-pro "Apply the type fixes you identified"
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Plan Your Workflow

Think about the natural progression of your task:

```bash
# Good: Logical progression
Research → Architecture → Implementation → Testing → Documentation

# Less optimal: Random switching without clear purpose
```

### 2. Match Tools to Tasks

Choose the right combination for each phase:

- **Research**: Models + browser sub-agent
- **Architecture**: Specialized agents + relevant sub-agents
- **Implementation**: Development agents with minimal sub-agents
- **Review**: Powerful models or review agents + security sub-agents

### 3. Maintain Context Awareness

Remember that conversation history carries forward:

```bash
# Good: Reference previous context
qckfx -c -a new-agent "Based on the security analysis we just completed, implement the fixes"

# Less clear: Assume context without reference
qckfx -c -a new-agent "Implement the fixes"
```

### 4. Use Descriptive Transitions

Make your intent clear when switching contexts:

```bash
# Good: Clear transition
qckfx -c -m claude-sonnet-4 "Now I need a more powerful model to analyze this complex algorithm"

# Better: Explain the switch
qckfx -c -a performance-agent "Switching to our performance specialist to optimize this code"
```

## Common Patterns Summary

| Pattern | Use Case | Example Transition |
|---------|----------|-------------------|
| **Agent → Model** | Specialized analysis → Quick questions | `security-agent` → `claude-sonnet-4` |
| **Model → Agent** | Brainstorming → Implementation | `claude-sonnet-4` → `fullstack-agent` |
| **Add Sub-agent** | Need specialized capability | Base → `--with-subagent browser` |
| **Remove Sub-agent** | Simplify for implementation | `--with-subagent research` → Base |
| **Model Scaling** | Adjust complexity/cost | `gemini-2.5-pro` → `claude-sonnet-4` |

## Troubleshooting

### Context Loss Issues

If context seems lost between switches:

```bash
# Verify you're in the same directory
pwd

# Check session exists
qckfx -c "Summarize our conversation so far"
```

### Configuration Conflicts

If agent/model combinations don't work as expected:

```bash
# Validate configurations
qckfx --validate my-agent.json

# Test sub-agent resolution
qckfx --with-subagent browser --validate
```

### Performance Considerations

For long conversations with many switches:

- Monitor token usage across different models
- Consider starting fresh sessions for unrelated topics
- Use cost-effective models for routine tasks
