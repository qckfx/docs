The qckfx CLI provides a powerful command-line interface for running AI agents, validating configurations, and managing sessions. This reference covers all available commands and options.

## Installation

The CLI is included with the `@qckfx/agent` package:

```bash
npm install -g @qckfx/agent
```

Or use it directly with npx:

```bash
npx @qckfx/agent "Your prompt here"
```

## Quick Start

Get started quickly by initializing a project with default agents:

```bash
# Initialize project with default agent configurations
qckfx init
```

Then use the CLI with direct prompts:

```bash
# Basic usage
qckfx "What files are in this directory?"

# With a specific model
qckfx -m claude-sonnet-4 "Analyze this codebase"

# Using an agent configuration
qckfx -a my-agent.json "List all TODOs in the code"
```

## Commands Overview

The qckfx CLI provides several key functionalities:

- **Project Initialization** - Set up new projects with default agent configurations
- **Agent Execution** - Run agents with prompts and configurations
- **Configuration Validation** - Validate agent configuration files
- **Session Management** - Continue previous conversations
- **Sub-agent Integration** - Add sub-agents dynamically

  If you run `qckfx` without a prompt, it will enter interactive mode and ask you to enter your prompt.

## Environment Variables

The CLI respects several environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `LLM_API_KEY` | API key for your model provider | Required |
| `LLM_BASE_URL` | Base URL for your model provider | Provider default |

<Tip>
You can override these environment variables using the `--api-key` and `--url` command-line options.
