## Simple Configuration

For quick and simple configuration, you can specify the model you would like qckfx to use from the command line:

```bash
qckfx -m openai/o3 "Create a plan for how to refactor auth.js"
```

You can change the model provider and your api key from the cli as well:

```bash
qckfx --url https://openrouter.ai/api/v1 --api-key my_openrouter_key -m google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview "Fix the login bug"
```

## Advanced Configuration

You can define custom agents down to the model they use, their system prompt, and what tools they can access. To do so, write a JSON file like the following:

```json
// agent.json
{
    "$schema": "https://unpkg.com/@qckfx/sdk-schema@latest/agent-config.schema.json",
    "defaultModel": "google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview",
    "systemPrompt": "You are a helpful AI assistant specialized in code review. Focus 
  on providing accurate code review comments using the available tools and the built-in github cli (gh).",
    "tools": [
      "bash",
      "glob",
      "grep",
      "ls",
      "file_read",
      "file_edit",
      "file_write",
      "think",
      "batch",
    ]
  }
```

Then pass this agent config file to qckfx:

```bash
qckfx -a agent.json "Review pull request #43"
```

### [Beta Feature] Sub-Agents

You can define sub-agents for your primary agent. This is useful for cases where you want a cheaper model to browse the codebase and find relevant files, or one larger planning and review model with a cheaper implementation model. You can nest sub-agents as deeply as you like.

**Example: o3 Planner with Sonnet-4 coder and Devstral browser**

To run this agent, you would use a command like the following: 

```bash
qckfx -a agent.json "Add unit tests for the auth.ts file"
```
