qckfx (pronounced "quick fix") is an open-source AI coding platform that offers two distinct products for different use cases:

## üöÄ qckfx CLI - Headless AI Coding Assistant

**Perfect for terminal-based workflows and automation**

The qckfx CLI is designed for developers who want a powerful AI coding assistant that can run headlessly in terminals, CI/CD pipelines, or GitHub Actions. It's optimized for automation and can operate with minimal human oversight.

```bash
npm install -g @qckfx/agent
qckfx "fix the type errors in the auth module"
```

**Key capabilities:**
- Natural language commands from terminal
- Headless operation for CI/CD and automation
- Custom agent configurations via JSON files
- Git operations, file editing, and code analysis
- Can run locally (with appropriate caution) or in sandboxed environments

**‚ö†Ô∏è Security Note:** While the CLI can run in your local terminal, it's designed for headless automation. When running locally, use appropriate caution as it can make real changes to your codebase.

## üõ†Ô∏è qckfx SDK - Embedded AI Agent Platform

**Perfect for building applications with integrated AI coding capabilities**

The qckfx SDK is a TypeScript/JavaScript library for developers who want to embed AI coding agents directly into their applications, providing full programmatic control over agent behavior.

```typescript
import { Agent } from '@qckfx/agent';

const agent = new Agent({
  defaultModel: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4',
  systemPrompt: 'You are a helpful AI coding agent...'
});

const result = await agent.processQuery('What does this repository do?');
```

**Key capabilities:**
- Full programmatic control over agent lifecycle
- Streaming updates and event handling
- User permission systems and checkpoints
- Custom tool configurations
- Integration into web apps, desktop apps, or services

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Shared Foundation

Both products share the same core capabilities:

- **Open source**: Full transparency and community-driven development
- **Provider flexibility**: Support for any LLM provider with OpenAI-compatible APIs
- **Dynamic codebase understanding**: No upfront indexing required
- **Comprehensive toolset**: File operations, bash commands, git integration, and more
- **Security focused**: Direct API connections and configurable execution environments

## Quick Tour

Here's what you can do with qckfx:

### CLI Examples
```bash
# Ask questions about your codebase
qckfx "how does our authentication system work?"

# Fix issues across multiple files
qckfx "fix the type errors in the auth module"

# Automate Git operations
qckfx "commit my changes and create a PR"
```

### SDK Examples
```typescript
// Process queries programmatically
const result = await agent.processQuery('What does this repository do?');

// Handle streaming updates
agent.on('toolCall', (tool) => console.log(`Using ${tool.name}`));

// Control permissions
const agent = new Agent(config, {
  onPermissionRequest: async (request) => await askUser(request)
});
```
