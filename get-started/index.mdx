qckfx makes building and deploying background AI coding agents as simple as editing a json file. You can use qckfx agents to do nearly anything related to the software developer lifecycle, from issue triage and code-writing to code review and documentation maintenance.

Here is all that's needed for a state-of-the-art code-writing agent to start working on your issue backlog:

  <Tab title=".qckfx/agents/coder.json">
    ```json
    {
      "$schema": "https://unpkg.com/@qckfx/sdk-schema@latest/agent-config.schema.json",
      "environment": {
        "type": "remote"
      },
      "defaultModel": "claude-sonnet-3-7",
      "systemPrompt": "You are an AI coding agent tasked with delivering fixes to issues in a code repository. You have access to a set of tools to help you navigate the codebase, make changes, and validate your changes. Always use best practices and formulate plans before starting your work.",
      "tools": [] // Empty array grants all built-in tools by default
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title=".qckfx/triggers/label-qckfx.json">
    ```json
    {
      "$schema": "https://unpkg.com/@qckfx/schema@latest/trigger-config.schema.json",
      "source": "github",
      "kind": "issue",
      "action": "labeled",
      "filter": {
        "label": "qckfx"
      },
      "agent": "coder"
    }
    ```

    And to make it even easier, we've created a bundled script to generate these files and get you up and running in less than 5 minutes. To get started, just click [here](/get-started/quickstart).

## Why qckfx?

Existing solutions are black-box, closed-source, and probably overcharging you or under-delivering.

You may have heard of OpenAI Codex or Claude Code. Claude Code is a closed source tool designed primarily for synchronous coding sessions and restricted to using Anthropic models. While Codex is open-source and allows use of any LLM model, it is not designed to be as configurable or easy to deploy as qckfx and its tools are purpose-built for OpenAI's own models.

Other solutions in the space like Devin and Cursor's background agents are closed source and black boxes in terms of implementation. Any choice you have of LLM model or agent architecture are severely limited and you have no way to manage the system prompt powering the agent itself.

qckfx uses our [open-source agent SDK](https://github.com/qckfx/agent-sdk) and an [open-source 'assist' website for debugging and working alongside your agents](https://github.com/qckfx/assist). We don't charge any premium on tokens, let you use whatever LLM models you want, and we let you spend whatever you need on tokens to get the job done. You can use our off-the-shelf open-source agents or design your own: picking system prompts, models, tools, and more.

We're flexible on self-hosting various parts of our infrastructure and encourage you to [reach out](mailto:chris.wood@qckfx.com) if that's something you're interested in.

We're interested in empowering teams to step into the future and take ownership of their  AI developer platform infrastructure. At qckfx, **we are doing the grunt work building infra for deploying, monitoring, and debugging AI coding agents so that you and your team can build the best AI internal developer tools for your unique team and codebase**.
