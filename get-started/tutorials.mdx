## Understand New Codebases

**When to use: **You've just joined a new project and are learning its structure.

1. Navigate to the project root directory

   ```
   cd /path/to/your/project
   ```
2. Start qckfx

   ```
   qckfx
   ```
3. Ask for a high-level overview

   ```
   > give me a high-level overview of this codebase
   ```
4. Dive deeper into specific components

   ```
   > create a mermaid chart for the data flow on auth
   ```

   ```
   > what critical architectural decisions have been made here?
   ```

   ```
   > describe how testing is managed for this project
   ```

**Tips:**

- Ask about coding conventions and patterns used in the project
- Request a glossary of project-specific terms
- Request a list and breakdown of sub-modules
- Start broad and then narrow with more detail

## Fix Bugs Efficiently

**When to use: **You have a failing test, an error message, or a stack trace and need to find and fix its source.

1. Share the error with qckfx

   ```
   > I'm hitting an error when I run npm test
   ```
2. Ask for fix recommendations

   ```
   > suggest a few ways to fix the error in auth.ts, recommend one fix and give your rationale.
   ```
3. Apply the fix

   ```
   > update auth.ts to fix the off-by-one error you discovered.
   ```

**Tips:**

- Tell qckfx how to reproduce the issue
- Let qckfx know if the issue happens consistently or not
