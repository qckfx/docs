## Detailed Comparison

### Use Case Scenarios

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Individual Developer">
    **Best Choice: CLI**
    
    As a solo developer, you want quick AI assistance while coding:
    
    ```bash
    # Quick help while coding
    qckfx "explain this error message"
    qckfx "fix the failing tests"
    qckfx "refactor this function to be more readable"
    ```
    
    **Why CLI wins:**
    - Instant access from any terminal
    - No application development needed
    - Works in any codebase immediately
    - Perfect for ad-hoc tasks
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Team Automation">
    **Best Choice: CLI**
    
    Your team wants automated AI assistance in CI/CD pipelines:
    
    ```yaml
    # GitHub Actions workflow
    - name: AI Code Review
      run: qckfx "review the changes in this PR and suggest improvements"
    ```
    
    **Why CLI wins:**
    - Designed for headless operation
    - Easy CI/CD integration
    - No custom development required
    - Consistent across different environments
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Application Developer">
    **Best Choice: SDK**
    
    You're building an IDE extension, web app, or service with AI features:
    
    ```typescript
    // Custom code review app
    const agent = new Agent(config);
    const review = await agent.processQuery('Review this code for security issues');
    
    // Display results in your UI
    displayCodeReview(review.response);
    ```
    
    **Why SDK wins:**
    - Full programmatic control
    - Custom UI integration
    - Event handling for responsive UIs
    - Session management for conversations
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Enterprise Integration">
    **Best Choice: SDK**
    
    You need to embed AI coding capabilities into existing enterprise software:
    
    ```typescript
    // Enterprise code analysis service
    const agent = new Agent({
      environment: { type: 'remote' }, // Secure sandboxing
      onPermissionRequest: async (req) => await checkComplianceRules(req)
    });
    ```
    
    **Why SDK wins:**
    - Enterprise-grade security controls
    - Custom permission systems
    - Integration with existing auth/audit systems
    - Scalable remote execution
  </Tab>

### Technical Capabilities

| Feature | CLI | SDK | Notes |
|---------|-----|-----|-------|
| **Installation** | Global npm install | Project dependency | CLI is system-wide, SDK is per-project |
| **Usage** | Command line | Programmatic API | CLI for terminal, SDK for applications |
| **Configuration** | JSON files + CLI flags | Code + JSON files | SDK offers more runtime flexibility |
| **Execution** | Headless by design | Local/Docker/Remote | SDK offers more environment options |
| **Streaming** | ❌ | ✅ | SDK provides real-time updates |
| **Session Management** | ❌ | ✅ | SDK maintains conversation context |
| **Permission Control** | Basic | Advanced | SDK allows custom permission logic |
| **Error Handling** | Basic | Advanced | SDK provides detailed error events |
| **UI Integration** | ❌ | ✅ | SDK designed for custom interfaces |

### Security Considerations

<Warning>
**CLI Security Note**: The CLI is designed for headless automation but can run locally. When running in your local terminal, it can make real changes to your codebase. Use appropriate caution and always work in version-controlled repositories.
</Warning>

<Info>
**SDK Security Note**: The SDK provides multiple execution environments (local, Docker, remote) and fine-grained permission controls, making it suitable for both development and production use cases.
</Info>

### Performance & Scalability

**CLI Performance:**
- Optimized for single-task execution
- Minimal overhead for automation scripts
- Best for batch processing and CI/CD

**SDK Performance:**
- Designed for long-running applications
- Session state management for efficiency
- Caching and connection pooling
- Better for interactive applications

### Learning Curve

<CardGroup cols={2}>

</CardGroup>

## Migration Paths

### From CLI to SDK

If you start with the CLI and later need SDK features:

```typescript
// Your CLI command
// qckfx "analyze this codebase"

// Equivalent SDK code
const agent = new Agent({
  defaultModel: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4',
  systemPrompt: 'You are a helpful AI coding agent...'
});

const result = await agent.processQuery('analyze this codebase');
```

### From SDK to CLI

If you have SDK code and want to automate it:

```json
// Create agent-config.json from your SDK config
{
  "defaultModel": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4",
  "systemPrompt": "You are a helpful AI coding agent...",
  "tools": ["bash", "file_read", "file_edit", "grep"]
}
```

```bash
# Run with CLI
qckfx -a agent-config.json "analyze this codebase"
```

## Common Misconceptions

<Accordion title="&quot;I need the SDK for advanced features&quot;">
**Not necessarily.** The CLI supports custom agent configurations, sub-agents, and all the same tools as the SDK. The main difference is the interface (command-line vs programmatic API).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="&quot;The CLI is just a wrapper around the SDK&quot;">
**Partially true.** While they share the same core engine, the CLI is optimized for headless operation and automation, while the SDK is optimized for application integration.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="&quot;I can't use both&quot;">
**False.** You can use both in the same project. For example, use the CLI for CI/CD automation and the SDK for a custom developer dashboard.
</Accordion>

## Decision Framework

Ask yourself these questions:

1. **Are you building an application?**
   - Yes → SDK
   - No → CLI

2. **Do you need a custom user interface?**
   - Yes → SDK
   - No → CLI

3. **Is this for automation/CI/CD?**
   - Yes → CLI
   - No → Consider both

4. **Do you need real-time streaming updates?**
   - Yes → SDK
   - No → Either works

5. **Do you need session management?**
   - Yes → SDK
   - No → Either works

## Next Steps

Still not sure? Start with the CLI - it's easier to get going and you can always add the SDK later if you need programmatic control.
