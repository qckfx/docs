## System Requirements

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Operating Systems" icon="desktop">
    - macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or newer
    - Ubuntu 20.04 / Debian 11 or newer  
    - Windows 10/11 with WSL or Git-Bash
  </Card>
  <Card title="Software Requirements" icon="code">
    - Node.js 18+ (required)
    - git 2.23+ (optional - for repo features)
    - 4 GB RAM minimum
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
  **Windows Users**: The CLI requires a Unix-like environment. Use WSL (recommended) or Git-Bash for the best experience.
</Warning>

## Quick Installation

### 1. Install the CLI globally

```bash
npm install -g @qckfx/agent
```

<Warning>
  Do NOT use `sudo npm install -g` as this can lead to permission issues and security risks.
</Warning>

### 2. Initialize your project with default agents

Get started quickly with the same agents we use to develop qckfx:

```bash
qckfx init
```

This creates a `.qckfx` directory with essential agent configurations:
- `advanced-agent.json` - General-purpose coding agent with browser sub-agent, uses OpenAI o3 for orchestration and Claude Code for implementation
- `agent-editor.json` - Specialized for editing system prompts in agent configuration files
- `commit.json` - Helps write good commit messages
- `sub-agents/browser.json` - Codebase research capabilities using GPT-4.1-nano for cost-efficient local file analysis
- `sub-agents/coder.json` - Advanced coding assistance

<Tip>
  The `init` command gives you the exact same agent configurations that the qckfx development team uses daily. It's the fastest way to get productive with qckfx.
</Tip>

### 3. Set up your LLM provider

qckfx works with any OpenAI-compatible API. Set your environment variables:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Anthropic (Claude)
export LLM_API_KEY="sk-ant-your-secret-key"
export LLM_BASE_URL="https://api.anthropic.com/v1/"
```

```bash OpenAI
export LLM_API_KEY="sk-your-openai-key"
export LLM_BASE_URL="https://api.openai.com/v1/"
```

```bash OpenRouter
export LLM_API_KEY="sk-or-your-openrouter-key"
export LLM_BASE_URL="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/"
```

```bash LiteLLM Proxy
export LLM_API_KEY="your-proxy-key"
export LLM_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8001/"
```

</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  Add these to your shell profile (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.) to persist them across sessions.
</Tip>

### 4. Run your first command

```bash
qckfx "Hello, world!"
```

If everything is set up correctly, qckfx will respond and you're ready to go!

## Your First Real Task

Let's try something more practical. Navigate to any code repository and run:

```bash
# Analyze your codebase
qckfx "What does this repository do? Give me a high-level overview."

# Fix common issues
qckfx "Check for any obvious bugs or issues in the codebase"

# Get help with specific files
qckfx "Explain what the main entry point file does"
```

### Continuing Conversations

qckfx automatically saves your conversation history. Use the `-c` flag to continue where you left off:

```bash
# Start a conversation
qckfx "Analyze the auth.js file and identify potential improvements"

# Continue the conversation later
qckfx -c "Now implement those improvements you suggested"

# Keep the conversation going
qckfx -c "Add unit tests for the changes you just made"
```

<Tip>
  Sessions are saved per working directory, so you can have different ongoing conversations for different projects.
</Tip>

## Interactive Mode

When you run `qckfx` without providing a prompt, the CLI enters **interactive mode** - a powerful feature that makes it easy to work with complex, multi-line inputs and pasted content.

### Entering Interactive Mode

Simply run the command without any arguments:

```bash
qckfx
```

You'll see an interactive prompt where you can compose your request:

```
> 
```

### Multi-line Input

Create multi-line prompts by ending lines with a backslash (`\`):

```
> Analyze this codebase and create a comprehensive report that includes: \
  - Architecture overview \
  - Code quality assessment \
  - Security considerations \
  - Performance recommendations
```

The backslash tells qckfx that your input continues on the next line, allowing you to structure complex requests clearly.

### Smart Paste Handling

Interactive mode intelligently handles pasted content, similar to Claude Code. When you paste large blocks of text, qckfx automatically:

1. **Detects the paste** and replaces it with a compact placeholder like `[paste #1 +25 lines]`
2. **Keeps your buffer clean** so you can see your actual prompt structure
3. **Substitutes the content at runtime** when you submit your request

This makes it easy to include code snippets, error messages, or documentation in your prompts without cluttering the input buffer.

#### Example Interactive Session

```
> I'm getting an error when running my tests. Here's the error output: \
  [paste #1 +15 lines] \
  \
  And here's the relevant test file: \
  [paste #2 +42 lines] \
  \
  Can you help me debug this issue?
```

### Submitting Your Request

Press **Enter** to submit your interactive prompt (or **Ctrl+D** as an alternative). qckfx will process your request with all pasted content properly included.

<Info>
  If your current line ends with a backslash (`\`), pressing Enter will continue to the next line instead of submitting. Only lines that don't end with `\` will submit when you press Enter.
</Info>

### When to Use Interactive Mode

Interactive mode is particularly useful for:

- **Complex prompts** that span multiple lines
- **Including code snippets** or error messages via paste
- **Structured requests** with multiple requirements
- **Exploratory conversations** where you want to compose thoughtfully

<Tip>
  Interactive mode is perfect for detailed code reviews, debugging sessions, and complex refactoring requests where you need to include multiple code snippets or detailed context.
</Tip>

## Beyond Basics: Advanced Patterns

### Using Different Models for Different Tasks

Mix models strategically - use powerful models for planning and cheaper ones for implementation:

```bash
# Use a powerful model for planning
qckfx -m openai/o1 "Create a comprehensive plan for refactoring this auth system"

# Use a cheaper model to implement the plan (continuing the session)
qckfx -c -m openai/gpt-4o-mini "Implement the auth refactoring plan from above"
```

### Adding Specialized Capabilities with Sub-agents

Sub-agents give your main agent specialized tools and capabilities:

```bash
# Add codebase research capabilities
qckfx --with-subagent browser "Analyze the codebase structure and identify patterns"

# Add multiple specialized agents for comprehensive analysis
qckfx --with-subagent browser database "Analyze our data architecture and research modern alternatives"

# Continue a conversation with sub-agents
qckfx -c --with-subagent security "Now audit the security of the changes we discussed"
```

### Configuration Preview

For complex workflows, create agent configuration files:

```json
// .qckfx/my-agent.json
{
  "defaultModel": "claude-sonnet-4",
  "systemPrompt": "You are a senior full-stack developer specializing in secure, scalable applications.",
  "tools": ["bash", "file_read", "file_write", "grep", "glob"]
}
```

```bash
# Use your custom agent
qckfx -a my-agent "Review this codebase for security and performance issues"
```

## Common CLI Patterns

### Quick Model Selection

```bash
# Use a specific model for one command
qckfx -m openai/gpt-4o "Refactor the auth.js file"

# Use a different provider
qckfx --url https://api.openai.com/v1 --api-key sk-... -m gpt-4o "Fix the tests"
```

### Interactive vs Non-Interactive Modes

```bash
# Interactive mode - for complex, multi-line prompts
qckfx  # Enters interactive mode with paste handling

# Non-interactive mode - for scripts and automation
qckfx "commit my changes with a descriptive message"

# Run with specific configuration
qckfx -a ./my-agent-config.json "Review the latest changes"
```

### Git Integration

```bash
# Analyze recent changes
qckfx "What changed in the last 3 commits?"

# Help with merge conflicts
qckfx "I have merge conflicts, help me resolve them"

# Create commits and PRs
qckfx "commit my changes and create a pull request"
```

## Safety and Security

<Warning>
  **Local Execution Warning**: The CLI can make real changes to your codebase when run locally. Always:
  - Work in a git repository with committed changes
  - Review changes before accepting them
  - Consider using sandboxed environments for untrusted code
</Warning>

### Recommended Safety Practices

1. **Use version control**: Always work in a git repository
2. **Commit frequently**: Save your work before running qckfx
3. **Review changes**: Check what qckfx modified before committing
4. **Sandbox for automation**: Use Docker or remote environments for CI/CD
