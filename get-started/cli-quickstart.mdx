The qckfx CLI is a powerful headless AI coding assistant designed for terminal workflows, automation, and CI/CD pipelines. This guide will get you running your first AI coding task in minutes.

## System Requirements

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Operating Systems" icon="desktop">
    - macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or newer
    - Ubuntu 20.04 / Debian 11 or newer  
    - Windows 10/11 with WSL or Git-Bash
  </Card>
  <Card title="Software Requirements" icon="code">
    - Node.js 18+ (required)
    - git 2.23+ (optional - for repo features)
    - 4 GB RAM minimum
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
  **Windows Users**: The CLI requires a Unix-like environment. Use WSL (recommended) or Git-Bash for the best experience.
</Warning>

## Quick Installation

### 1. Install the CLI globally

```bash
npm install -g @qckfx/agent
```

<Warning>
  Do NOT use `sudo npm install -g` as this can lead to permission issues and security risks.
</Warning>

### 2. Set up your LLM provider

qckfx works with any OpenAI-compatible API. Set your environment variables:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Anthropic (Claude)
export LLM_API_KEY="sk-ant-your-secret-key"
export LLM_BASE_URL="https://api.anthropic.com/v1/"
```

```bash OpenAI
export LLM_API_KEY="sk-your-openai-key"
export LLM_BASE_URL="https://api.openai.com/v1/"
```

```bash OpenRouter
export LLM_API_KEY="sk-or-your-openrouter-key"
export LLM_BASE_URL="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/"
```

```bash LiteLLM Proxy
export LLM_API_KEY="your-proxy-key"
export LLM_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8001/"
```

</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  Add these to your shell profile (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.) to persist them across sessions.
</Tip>

### 3. Run your first command

```bash
qckfx "Hello, world!"
```

If everything is set up correctly, qckfx will respond and you're ready to go!

## Your First Real Task

Let's try something more practical. Navigate to any code repository and run:

```bash
# Analyze your codebase
qckfx "What does this repository do? Give me a high-level overview."

# Fix common issues
qckfx "Check for any obvious bugs or issues in the codebase"

# Get help with specific files
qckfx "Explain what the main entry point file does"
```

## Common CLI Patterns

### Quick Model Selection

```bash
# Use a specific model for one command
qckfx -m openai/gpt-4o "Refactor the auth.js file"

# Use a different provider
qckfx --url https://api.openai.com/v1 --api-key sk-... -m gpt-4o "Fix the tests"
```

### Automation-Friendly Commands

```bash
# Non-interactive mode (good for scripts)
qckfx "commit my changes with a descriptive message"

# Run with specific configuration
qckfx -a ./my-agent-config.json "Review the latest changes"
```

### Git Integration

```bash
# Analyze recent changes
qckfx "What changed in the last 3 commits?"

# Help with merge conflicts
qckfx "I have merge conflicts, help me resolve them"

# Create commits and PRs
qckfx "commit my changes and create a pull request"
```

## Safety and Security

<Warning>
  **Local Execution Warning**: The CLI can make real changes to your codebase when run locally. Always:
  - Work in a git repository with committed changes
  - Review changes before accepting them
  - Consider using sandboxed environments for untrusted code
</Warning>

### Recommended Safety Practices

1. **Use version control**: Always work in a git repository
2. **Commit frequently**: Save your work before running qckfx
3. **Review changes**: Check what qckfx modified before committing
4. **Sandbox for automation**: Use Docker or remote environments for CI/CD

## Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

<Accordion title="Command not found: qckfx">
  Make sure you installed globally and that your npm global bin directory is in your PATH:
  ```bash
  npm list -g @qckfx/agent  # Should show the package
  npm config get prefix     # Check your global prefix
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Permission denied errors">
  Don't use sudo with npm. Instead, configure npm to use a different directory:
  ```bash
  mkdir ~/.npm-global
  npm config set prefix '~/.npm-global'
  echo 'export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
  source ~/.bashrc
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="API key or connection errors">
  Verify your environment variables are set correctly:
  ```bash
  echo $LLM_API_KEY    # Should show your key
  echo $LLM_BASE_URL   # Should show your provider URL
  ```
</Accordion>

## What's Next?

Now that you have the CLI working, you can:

- **Automate your workflow**: Use qckfx in scripts and CI/CD pipelines
- **Customize behavior**: Create agent configuration files for specific tasks
- **Integrate with tools**: Combine qckfx with your existing development tools
- **Scale up**: Consider the SDK if you need programmatic control for applications
